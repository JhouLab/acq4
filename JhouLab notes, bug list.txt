Using Python 3.11, and venv (because conda or mamba environments didn't allow all packages to be installed without pip)

Additional packages beyond those listed in requirements that need to be installed for acq4 to work:

vispy 0.14.3
teleprox 1.0 (requires pip)
pyzmq 26.2.0
msgpack 1.1.0 (requires pip)
pydaqmx (PyDAQmx)

Errors that I have fixed so far:

Upon launching Patch1: acq4/modules/Patch/PatchWindow.py, line 86. self.width() is not a multiple of four, crashes.

Upon closing Patch1: acq4/modules/Patch/PatchWindow.py, line 163. numpy has no attribute str
