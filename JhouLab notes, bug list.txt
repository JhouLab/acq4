Using Python 3.11 and PyQt5 under Windows 10 and 11.

Have tried conda environment, mamba, and now venv virtual environment. Behavior seems similar on all three.

GUI does not launch, until the following packages are manually installed. These are not listed in ./tools/requirements/qt5-generic.yml:

vispy 0.14.3
teleprox 1.0 (requires pip)
pyzmq 26.2.0
msgpack 1.1.0 (requires pip)
pydaqmx (PyDAQmx)

After installing, additional errors preventing usage are as follows:

Upon clicking Patch1 option, GUI crashes with error in acq4/modules/Patch/PatchWindow.py, line 86.
  Error: .setSizes expects integer argument, but self.width()/4 is floating point, causing crash.
  Solution: replace / with integer divide //, and remove decimal point after 3. and 4.

Upon closing Patch1 GUI window, received error in acq4/modules/Patch/PatchWindow.py, line 163.
  Error: numpy has no attribute str (this was deprecated in numpy 1.20, and removed starting with 1.24, whereas I am using 2.1.3)
  Solution: replace np.str() with str()
