Using Python 3.11, PyQt5, and venv virtual environment (also tried conda and mamba, with similar results).


Additional packages beyond those listed in requirements that need to be installed for acq4 to work:

vispy 0.14.3
teleprox 1.0 (requires pip)
pyzmq 26.2.0
msgpack 1.1.0 (requires pip)
pydaqmx (PyDAQmx)

Errors that I have fixed so far:

Upon launching Patch1: acq4/modules/Patch/PatchWindow.py, line 86. self.width() is an integer, but after dividing by 4 becomes a floating point, which causes crash.
Solution was to replace / with integer divide //, and also replace 3. with 3, and 4. with 4

Upon closing Patch1: acq4/modules/Patch/PatchWindow.py, line 163. numpy has no attribute str. Solution was to replace np.str() with str()
